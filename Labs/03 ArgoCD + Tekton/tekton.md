## <font color='red'> 2.1 GitOps </font>
GitOps is a framework and set of best practices for Kubernetes cluster management and application delivery.  It works by using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. 

With GitOps, the use of software agents can alert on any divergence between Git with what's running in a cluster, and if there's a difference, Kubernetes reconcilers automatically update or rollback the cluster depending on the case. 

With Git at the center of your delivery pipelines, developers use familiar tools to make pull requests to accelerate and simplify both application deployments and operations tasks to Kubernetes.

The GitOps module introduces the key concepts and some of the CI-CD tools:
* Docker Hub
* GitHub / GitLab
* Skaffold
* ArgoCD
* Flux

* Monitoring Tools
  - Prometheus
  - Grafana
